\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusions}


\noindent The proposed model reaches an accuracy of 80.3\%, which is below the initial expectations. The causes have to be seeked in the preprocessing and features extraction phase of the workflow, since there no doubts on the efficiency of the proposed CNN, also observing how other papers addressing the same KWS problem, rely on similar model architectures.
